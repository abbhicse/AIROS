    "One of the easiest examples to understand is the simple car, which is shown in Figure 13.1. We all know that a car cannot drive sideways because the back wheels would have to slide instead of roll. This is why parallel parking is challenging. If all four wheels could be turned simultaneously toward the curb, it would be trivial to park a car. The complicated maneuvers for parking a simple car arise because of rolling constraints. \n"

    " The car can be imagined as a rigid body that moves in the plane. Therefore, its C-space is $ {\\cal C}= {\\mathbb{R}}^2 \\times {\\mathbb{S}}^1$. Figure 13.1 indicates several parameters associated with the car. A configuration is denoted by $ q = (x,y,\\theta)$. The body frame of the car places the origin at the center of rear axle, and the $ x$-axis points along the main axis of the car. Let $ s$ denote the (signed) speed13.2 of the car. Let $ \\phi $ denote the steering angle (it is negative for the wheel orientations shown in Figure 13.1). The distance between the front and rear axles is represented as $ L$. If the steering angle is fixed at $ \\phi $, the car travels in a circular motion, in which the radius of the circle is $ \\rho$. Note that $ \\rho$ can be determined from the intersection of the two axes shown in Figure 13.1 (the angle between these axes is $ \\vert\\phi\\vert$).\n",

    " It was shown in Dubin's paper \"On curves of minimal length with a constraint on average curvature, and with prescribed initial and terminal positions and tangents\" that between any two configurations, the shortest path for the Dubins car can always be expressed as a combination of no more than three motion primitives. Each motion primitive applies a constant action over an interval of time. Furthermore, the only actions that are needed to traverse the shortest paths are $ u \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. The primitives and their associated symbols are shown in Figure 15.3. The $ S$ primitive drives the car straight ahead. The $ L$ and $ R$ primitives turn as sharply as possible to the left and right, respectively. Using these symbols, each possible kind of shortest path can be designated as a sequence of three symbols that corresponds to the order in which the primitives are applied. Let such a sequence be called a word . There is no need to have two consecutive primitives of the same kind because they can be merged into one. Under this observation, ten possible words of length three are possible. Dubins showed that only these six words are possibly optimal:\n",
